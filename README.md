As you can see, the assembly algorithm is more efficient, beating the C++ algorithm in 0.02 seconds while the C++ search took 0.044. This was a project for one of my classes and it demonstrated how to access an array in assembly, and observe how assembly language procedures can be used to optimize programs.
